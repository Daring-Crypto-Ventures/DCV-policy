# Daring Crypto Ventures LLC Policy documents

### What is this?
This is the source of several "legal documents" (community guidelines, privacy, TOS, etc.) for Daring Crypto Ventures LLC projects.
These are heavily customized but orginally based on Wordpress's legal docs; as both companies are ailgned in the spirit of wanting an open and accessible web.

### What can I do with it?
Since these documents are licensed under a Creative Commons license (see below for more information), please feel free to re-use and edit these terms to fit your own use.

If you notice any typos or would like to suggest any changes, please contribute a pull request.
