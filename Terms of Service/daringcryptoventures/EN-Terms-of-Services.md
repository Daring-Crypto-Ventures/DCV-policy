# Terms & Conditions

## Who We Are and What This Policy Covers
We are here to help crypto go mainstream. Moreover, we are here to fuel cryptocurrency adoption by building a community of self-reliant crypto HODLers in full compliance with tax laws and regulations. Our mission is ambitious but grounded in the fact that anyone armed with the right information and training can truly unbank themselves and take control of their financial lives.

These Terms & Conditions (“Terms”) describe our commitments to you, and your rights and responsibilities when using our services. Please read them carefully and reach out to us if you have any questions. **These Terms include a mandatory arbitration provision. If you don’t agree to these Terms, don’t use our services.**

## Your Account
Accessing the DCV School requires a Teachable account. Your Teachable account is subject to [Teachable's Terms of Use](https://teachable.com/terms-of-use). DCV has some limited access to the account information you provide to Teachable, which we will use to keep you informed about the course and so that we can communicate with you about your account. We may need to send you emails about notable updates (like changes to our Terms or Privacy Policy), or to let you know about legal inquiries or complaints we receive about the ways you use our Services so you can make informed choices in response.

When you enroll in a DCV School course or opt-in to a email newsletter about the School or our courses, we will consider that to be an inquiry about our products and services, which means that we may also contact you to share more details about what we have to offer (i.e., marketing). Don’t worry — if you aren’t interested, you can opt out of the marketing communications, whether it’s an email, phone call, or text message.

You’re solely responsible and liable for all activity under your account. You’re also fully responsible for maintaining the security of your account (which includes keeping your password secure). We’re not liable for any acts or omissions by you, including any damages of any kind incurred as a result of your acts or omissions.

Don’t share or misuse your access credentials. And notify us immediately of any unauthorized uses of your account, store, or website, or of any other breach of security. If we believe your account has been compromised, we may suspend or disable it.

If you'd like to learn about how we handle the data you provide us, please see our [Privacy Policy](https://dogracer.github.io/DCV-policy/Privacy-Policy).

## Minimum Age Requirements
Our Services are not directed to children. You’re not allowed to access or use our Services if you’re under the age of 13. If you register as a user or otherwise use our Services, you represent that you’re at least 13. You may use our Services only if you can legally form a binding contract with us. In other words, if you’re under 18 years of age (or the legal age of majority where you live), you can only use our Services under the supervision of a parent or legal guardian who agrees to the Agreement.

## Use License

Permission is granted to temporarily download one copy of any downloadable materials on the School’s website for personal, non-commercial transitory viewing only. This is the grant of a license, not a transfer of title, and under this license you may not:

## Links
The School has not reviewed all of the sites linked to its website and is not responsible for the contents of any such linked site. The inclusion of any link does not imply endorsement of the site by the School or DCV. Use of any such linked website is at the user's own risk.

## Third-Party Services
While using the Services, you may enable, use, or purchase services, products, software, embeds, or applications (like themes, extensions, plugins, or blocks) developed by a third party or yourself (“Third-Party Services”).
If you use any Third-Party Services, you understand that:

There are a few other things we want to highlight: While taking a course at our School, if decide to you use Google Sheets then your use is subject to [Google’s Terms of Use](https://policies.google.com/terms) for the services, which you’ll accept before using their services for the first time. DCV makes a Google Sheet Add-on and that software's use is subject to its own [Terms & Conditions](https://dogracer.github.io/DCV-policy/Terms%20of%20Service/hodl-totals/EN-Terms-of-Service). We make no warranties about Google’s services, and disclaim Google’s liability for any damages arising from our distribution, resale or use of their services. Google will provide technical support for its services, per its [Technical Support Services Guidelines](https://www.google.com/apps/intl/en/terms/tssg.html). 

## Disclaimers
The materials on the School’s website are provided "as is". The School makes no warranties, expressed or implied, and hereby disclaims and negates all warranties of any kind, including without limitation, implied warranties or conditions of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement of intellectual property or other violation of rights. Further, the School does not warrant or make any representations concerning the accuracy, likely results, or reliability of the use of the materials on its website or otherwise relating to such materials or on any sites linked to this site.

If you get audited, landed with a big tax bill or hit with penalties by the IRS due to crypto tax reporting choices you made based on information provided by the School, that’s on you. Currently in the US there are many gray areas of crypto taxation. Though we do our best to supply correct information to help you navigate these gray areas, you need to do your own research to ensure that you are in full compliance with tax laws and regulations, given your specific circumstances.

DCV does not make any warranty that our Services will be error free or that access thereto will be continuous or uninterrupted. You understand that you download from, or otherwise obtain content or services through, our Services at your own discretion and risk.

## Limitations
In no event shall the School be liable for any damages (including, without limitation, damages for loss of data or profit, or due to business interruption) arising out of the use or inability to use the materials on the School’s website, even if the School or authorized representative of the School has been notified orally or in writing of the possibility of such damage. In no event will DCV, or its partners, be liable with respect to any subject matter of the Agreement under any contract, negligence, strict liability or other legal or equitable theory for: (i) any special, incidental or consequential damages; (ii) the cost of procurement for substitute products or services; or (iii) for interruption of use or loss or corruption of data. DCV shall have no liability for any failure or delay due to matters beyond its reasonable control. Because some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on implied warranties, or limitations of liability for consequential or incidental damages, these limitations may not apply to you.

## Revisions and Errata
The materials appearing on the School’s website may include technical, typographical, or photographic errors. The School does not warrant that any of the materials on its web site are accurate, complete, or current. The School may make changes to the materials contained on its web site at any time without notice. The School does not, however, make any commitment to update the materials.

## Terms Modifications
The School may revise these Terms at any time without notice. We may update, change, or discontinue any aspect of our Services at any time. Since we’re constantly updating our Services, we sometimes have to change the legal terms under which they’re offered. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the change log below, and, in some cases, we may provide additional notice (like adding a statement to our homepage, blog or sending you a notification through email or your dashboard). Your continued use of our Services after the new terms take effect will be subject to the new terms, so if you disagree with the changes in the new terms, you should stop using our Services. By using this website you are agreeing to be bound by the then current version of these Terms of Use.

Except to the extent any applicable law provides otherwise, the Agreement and any access to or use of our Services will be governed by the laws of the state of Texas, U.S.A., excluding its conflict of law provisions. The proper venue for any disputes arising out of or relating to the Agreement and any access to or use of our Services that are not otherwise subject to arbitration (as indicated below) will be the state and federal courts located in Dallas, Texas.

## Arbitration Agreement
Except for claims for injunctive or equitable relief or claims regarding intellectual property rights (which may be brought in any competent court without the posting of a bond), any dispute arising under the Agreement shall be finally settled in accordance with the Comprehensive Arbitration Rules of the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Service, Inc. (“JAMS”) by arbitrators appointed in accordance with such Rules. The arbitration shall take place in Dallas, Texas in the English language and the arbitral decision may be enforced in any court. The prevailing party in any action or proceeding to enforce the Agreement shall be entitled to costs and attorneys’ fees.

## Indemnification
You agree to indemnify and hold harmless DCV, its contractors, respective directors, officers, employees, and agents from and against any and all losses, liabilities, demands, damages, costs, claims, and expenses, including attorneys’ fees, arising out of or related to your use of our Services, including but not limited to your violation of the Agreement or any agreement with a provider of third-party services used in connection with the Services.

## US Economic Sanctions
You may not use the Services if such use is inconsistent with U.S. sanctions law or if you are on any list maintained by a U.S. government authority relating to designated, restricted or prohibited persons.

## Translation
These Terms were originally written in English (US). We may translate these terms into other languages, and in the event of a conflict between a translated version of these Terms and the English version, the English version will control.

## Miscellaneous
The Agreement (together with any other terms we provide that apply to any specific Service) constitutes the entire agreement between DCV and you concerning our Services. If any part of the Agreement is unlawful, void, or unenforceable, that part is severable from the Agreement, and does not affect the validity or enforceability of the rest of the Agreement. A waiver by either party of any term or condition of the Agreement or any breach thereof, in any one instance, will not waive such term or condition or any subsequent breach thereof.
DCV may assign its rights under the Agreement without condition. You may only assign your rights under the Agreement with our prior written consent.
