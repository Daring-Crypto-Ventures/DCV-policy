## Privacy Information

Please review our [Privacy Policy](https://dogracer.github.io/DCV-policy/Privacy-Policy) to undestand our practices.

## Confidentiality

“Confidential Information” means all non-public information disclosed in written, oral or visual form by either party or its affiliates (the “disclosing party”) to the other or its affiliates (the “receiving party”). Confidential Information may include, but is not limited to, services, cryptocurrency addresses, cryptocurrency wallet information, coin price data, computer programs, source code, names and expertise of employees and consultants, know-how, and other technical, business, financial and product development information. Confidential Information does not include any information that the receiving party can demonstrate by its written records (1) was rightfully known to it without obligation of confidentiality prior to its disclosure hereunder by the disclosing party; (2) is or becomes publicly known through no wrongful act of the receiving party, its affiliates and/or their employees and contractors; (3) has been rightfully received without obligation of confidentiality from a third party authorized to make such a disclosure; or (4) is independently developed by the receiving party without reference to or use of, directly or indirectly, confidential information disclosed hereunder.

Pursuant to our [Legal Guidelines](https://dogracer.github.io/DCV-policy/Legal-Guidelines), neither party will use any Confidential Information of the other party except (i) as necessary to exercise its rights and fulfill its obligations under these Terms, (ii) as expressly permitted by these Terms or (iii) as expressly authorized in writing by the disclosing party. The receiving party shall use the same degree of care to protect the disclosing party’s Confidential Information as it uses to protect its own Confidential Information of like nature, but in no circumstances less than a reasonable standard of care. The receiving party may not disclose the disclosing party’s Confidential Information to any person or entity other than to those of its affiliates, employees and contractors (and its affiliates’ employees and contractors) who: (i) are subject to a written agreement with the receiving party that includes use and confidentiality restrictions that are at least as protective as those set forth in these Terms, and (ii) need access to such Confidential Information solely for the purpose of fulfilling the receiving party’s obligations or exercising the receiving party’s rights hereunder. DCV may also disclose Customer’s Confidential Information to Google Inc (or any of its affiliate) for the sole purpose of rendering the Service. The foregoing obligations will not restrict the receiving party from disclosing Confidential Information of the disclosing party: (1) pursuant to the order or requirement of a court, administrative agency, or other governmental body, provided that the receiving party required to make such a disclosure gives reasonable notice to the disclosing party prior to such disclosure; and (2) on a confidential basis to its legal and financial advisors.
